2. Non-Access Modifiers
These provide additional functionality or behavior.

final: Indicates that a variable's value cannot be changed, a method cannot be overridden, or a class cannot be subclassed.
abstract: Indicates that a class cannot be instantiated or a method must be implemented by subclasses.
